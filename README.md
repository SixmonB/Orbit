# Orbit
Unity 2021.3.19f1

Simple projet with a Game Manager spawning a cube and a sphere. The idea is that the cube behaves as a center of orbit and the sphere rotates around the position of the cube,
according to an orbit axis.

Function 1: When clicking on the cube, we assign a random color to the objects.

Function 2: When pressing the spacebar, the orbit axis inverts itself and the sphere starts rotating in the other sense.
